    <h2>Investment Process</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">Target trends and industries</p>
	</header>
    <p>We strive to make investments only in the fastest-growing areas within the technology and cleantech sectors, and our process begins by identifying specific target trends and industries that we believe are suitable for investment. Before making any particular investment, we subject the target company to rigorous due diligence, which often includes technology assessment, customer/partner interviews, market/competitive analysis, financial analysis, and background/reference checks. Our equity investments typically consist of preferred stock, common stock, warrants, or convertible debt, although short-term debt investments may be employed under certain circumstances. Our investment size is typically $1 million to $10 million each, although this range will vary in proportion to the size of our capital base. Outlined below are several of the key characteristics we seek in our portfolio companies.</p>
