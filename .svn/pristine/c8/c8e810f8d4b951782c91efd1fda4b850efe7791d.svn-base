        <h3>Additional Information</h3>
      
      
      <p>On April 27, 2016, the Fund announced a plan to repurchase up to $2 million worth of SVVC stock in the open market by September 30, 2016. Through the end of August, we had repurchased and retired 221,536 shares of stock, at a total cost of approximately $1.7 million. As of August 31, 2016, the Fund had 7,481,169 shares outstanding.</p>
      

<p>The Fund also announced that, as of August 31, 2016, estimated net assets of the Fund were approximately $166 million, or $22.14 per share, including cash of approximately $0.83 per share. As of that date, the Fund’s top five holdings constituted 55.3% of the Fund’s estimated net assets. Complete financial statements and a detailed schedule of investments as of June 30, 2016, are available with the Fund’s quarterly report filing on <a href="index.php?fuseaction=about.filings">Form 10-Q</a>.</p>
  

<h4>*Estimated net assets as of August 31, 2016, represent net assets of approximately $166 million as of June 30, 2016, plus the net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation and realized gains/losses on publicly traded and private securities since June 30, 2016. For the purposes of calculating the percentage of net assets represented by each investment, the value of each holding is determined by the most recent of: (1) the purchase price, (2) the market value for public securities, less any discounts taken due restrictions on the stock, or (3) the June 30, 2016, fair value of each security, as determined under procedures approved by our Board of Directors.</h4>
