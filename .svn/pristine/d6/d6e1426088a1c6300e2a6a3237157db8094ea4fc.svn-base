    <p>Pivotal Systems provides monitoring and process control technologies for the semiconductor manufacturing industry.</p>
    <p class="main">As device feature sizes in the semiconductor industry continue to shrink, the importance of manufacturing process control is magnified. Using Pivotal's products, chip manufacturers can increase yield and tool productivity by monitoring in real-time and controlling some of the most critical parameters of wafer processing today: Gas Flow and Chamber Condition.</p>
    <p>Pivotal's gas flow controllers (GFCs) are currently in the qualification process at several of the world's largest semiconductor manufacturers as well as two of the top semiconductor equipment suppliers. Pivotal began volume shipments in 2014, most notably to Samsung, the worlds largest chip manufacturer. Samsung has used the GFCs to update older manufacturing lines and is featuring them in what is arguably the most advanced semiconductor production line in the world.</p>

  <p>In August 2015, Pivotal was named to Inc. magazine's Inc. 500&#151;an exclusive ranking of the fastest-growing private companies in the United States. Pivotal ranked 301st on the list overall, and ranked #1 among engineering companies. You can read more about the list <a href="http://www.inc.com/profile/pivotal-systems" target="new">here</a>.</p>
  <p>In November 2016, Pivotal announced record quarterly revenues and bookings as well as a <a href="../docs/press_110116.pdf" target="new">new round of funding</a>.
