<p>On April 27, 2016, the Fund announced a plan to repurchase up to $2 million worth of SVVC stock in the open market by September 30, 2016.

<h4>*Estimated net assets as of July 31, 2016 represent net assets of approximately $166 million as of June 30, 2016, plus the net change in realized and unrealized gains/losses on publicly traded securities since June 30, 2016. For the purposes of calculating the percentage of net assets represented by each investment, the value of each holding is determined by the most recent of: (1) the purchase price, (2) the market value for public securities, less any discounts taken due restrictions on the stock, or (3) the June 30, 2016 fair value of each security, as determined by our Board of Directors.</h4>
