        <p>Wrightspeed, Inc. provides electric drivetrains as retrofit kits to the medium-duty truck market. The company's electric-powered drive system provides customers with exceptional efficiency, low emissions, and full power and torque. It utilizes plug-in grid power, regenerative braking, and a turbine generator for highly efficient range extension. We believe the tremendous potential fuel savings to the trucking industry represents a significant revenue opportunity for Wrightspeed.<br /><br />In 2014 Wrightspeed announced that it had commenced commercial shipments of its powertrains to FedEx. Following field testing of the initial trucks, FedEx presented the company with an order for an additional 25 powertrains. Separately, the company announced that it received a 17 unit order from The Ratto Group, a Santa Rosa, California-based provider of refuse and recycling services. Garbage trucks, like delivery vehicles, perform hundreds or thousands of stops-and-gos per day, making them a perfect fit for Wrightspeed powertrains.</p>
        <h3>News</h3> 
       <p>In April 2016, Wrightspeed announced a $30 million order from NZ Bus, New Zealand's largest urban bus operator. Wrightspeed will provide its award-winning powertrain technology&#151;the Route&trade; 500&#151;to NZ Bus, marking the company's expansion into mass transit. The company has previously announced contracts with FedEx and The Ratto Group for delivery trucks and garbage/recycling trucks, respectively.
