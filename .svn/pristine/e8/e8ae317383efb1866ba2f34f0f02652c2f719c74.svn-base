    <p>Sunrun, which went public in August 2015, offers "solar-as-a-service" to residential customers. The company enables homeowners to benefit from the lower cost of solar electricity without the upfront expense of purchasing and installing the solar hardware. With third-party owned installation, a homeowner doesn't pay for the installation, but rather pays a monthly lease payment to the owner, such as Sunrun.</p>
    <p>Public competitor SolarCity (NASDAQ: SCTY) has demonstrated that the TPO (third-party ownership) solar business can offer solid growth and predictable, recurring revenue. Until relatively recently, Sunrun had historically taken a more conservative approach to building its business, shunning an in-house installation force. In early 2014, the company acquired the residential division of REC Solar, adding an experienced team of residential solar sales, design, and installation professionals.</p>
