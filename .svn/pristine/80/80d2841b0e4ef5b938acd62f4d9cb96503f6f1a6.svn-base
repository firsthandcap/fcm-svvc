    <p class="subtitle">Vufine reaches Kickstarter goal for its wearable display</p>
    </header>
	<p><a href="index.php?fuseaction=companies.vufine">Vufine</a> launched a Kickstarter campaign on June 22, 2015, with the goal of raising $50,000 to bring its wearable display to market. It met that goal in less than a week. Vufine's wearable display is not a computer, so there is no camera and no operating system, keeping the device affordable at $149.</p>

<p>Vufine attaches to a wide variety of glasses using a magnetic connector and plugs in to a multitude of devices with a special, thin HDMI cable. Vufine is an extension of user technology, not a replacement&#151;think of it like real-life picture-in-picture that allows consumers to enjoy the functionality of their favorite technology in a new way.</p>

<p>Vufine successfully completed its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1991375881/vufine-a-handsfree-wearable-display" target="new">Kickstarter campaign</a> on August 22, 2015, raising $241,111. </p>
