    <p class="subtitle">IPO - October 7, 2015</p>
    </header>
  <p>We made our initial investment in Pure Storage (PSTG) in September 2015, less than a month before the company's IPO. The company went public on October 7, 2015. Pure Storage (PSTG) is an enterprise data flash storage company, which was founded in 2009. The company's FlashArray product uses multi-level cell flash memory, which offers a higher capacity than single-level cell memory, but at comparable prices. FlashArray is used in data centers to speed up virtualization applications, databases, and cloud services.</p>
