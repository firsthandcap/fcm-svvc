        </header>
		
   <p>We made our initial investment in advertising technology company Turn in 2013. In February the company announced it was being acquired by Amobee, a subsidary of Singtel, one of the largest mobile network operators in Singapore. In late May 2017, the Fund received approximately $13.5 million in cash proceeds from the sale and may receive additional consideration at a later date if certain conditions are met.</p>
