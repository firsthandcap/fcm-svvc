	<h4>Share Repurchase Plan</h4> 
<p>On August 31, 2018, the Fund announced a plan to repurchase up to $2 million worth of SVVC stock in the open market by March 31, 2019. Through the end of September, we had repurchased and retired 26,110 shares of stock at a total cost of approximately $420,000. As of September 30, 2018, the Fund had 7,276,036 shares outstanding.</p>

<h4>*Estimated net assets as of August 31, 2018, represent net assets of approximately $186 million as of June 30, 2018, plus the net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation and realized gains/losses on publicly traded and private securities since June 30, 2018. For the purposes of calculating the percentage of net assets represented by each investment, the value of each holding is determined by the most recent of: (1) the purchase price, (2) the market value for public securities, less any discounts taken due to restrictions on the stock, or (3) the June 30, 2018, fair value of each security, as determined under procedures approved by our Board of Directors.
