    <p>We made our initial investment in Facebook, a leading social networking company, in 2011. On May 18, 2012, the company completed its IPO, with an opening price of $38. In September 2014, we liquidated our Facebook holdings, realizing a $27 million gain and a 144% return on investment. The gain was distributed to shareholders in November 2014.</p>
